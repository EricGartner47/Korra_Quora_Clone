## Application Architecture
Korra is built with a PUG frontend and an Express backend. PostgreSQL is also used as a database.

## Frontend Technologies Used 
Korra uses PUG to generate the HTML elements, and then we use CSS to handling the styling of those elements.

## Backend Technologies Used
We used an Express server to handle the backend communication because we have the most experience with this language for backend development. We used PostgreSQL because it is easy for us to use and manipulate with sequelize. Again, we used sequelize because of the ease of use as well as our familiarity with the language.

## Key Features
### User Authorization
User authorization is handling in JS using BCrypt for passowrd hasing. When users log in, the password they provide is rehashed and checked agains the original password.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
We are happy with the functionality, however, we wished we were able to complete editing comments. Additionally, we would like to add more to the styling to the site to mimic Quora. Finally, we plan to complete the bonus features of a voting systems as well as replies to comments.
