# Korra - A Quora Clone

## At A Glance
Korra is a full stack web application that allows logged users to post questions by topic. Logged in users may also post answers to posted questions and post comments to answers.

## Application Architecture
Korra is built with a PUG frontend and an Express backend. PostgreSQL is also used for database queries.

## Frontend Overview
Korra uses PUG and CSS for its frontend logic.

### Frontend Technologies Used

#### PUG
Korra uses PUG to display the frontend log.

#### CSS
Korra uses CSS to handle its styling of the PUG frontend.

## Backend Overview
Korra uses an Express server and PostgreSQL database.

### Backend Technologies Used

#### ExpressJS
We used an Express server to handle the backend communication because we have the most experience with this language for backend development.

#### PostgreSQL
We used PostgreSQL because it is easy for us to use and manipulate with sequelize.

#### Sequelize
Again, we used sequelize because of the ease of use as well as our familiarity with the language.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
We are happy with the functionality, but we would like to add more to the styling.
